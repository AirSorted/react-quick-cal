### How to make changes and update the Host Dashboard

* Run `yarn start` and open [localhost:9001](http://localhost:9001/) to make changes
* When you are done run `yarn build` to build the production minified code
* Commit and submit for review
* Once merged update the `package.json` in [Host Dashboard](https://github.com/AirSorted/host) with the hash of your commit e.g.

      "react-quick-cal": "git://github.com/AirSorted/react-quick-cal.git#f2b126ff8de012a214fa711f503a508de3940feb"
